### Scenarios

Matt had a late night last night and is feeling pretty crappy today, which sucks because he has a playoff game later. He's trying to decide whether to have a mimosa brunch with his bro, or just take it easy so he can bring his A game tonight. It depends on who he's playing - the Lake Austin Otters (we got this) or Pleasant Valley Parrots (oh shit.) 

Lindsey had a super crazy day at work today and didn't notice that there was a 80% change of thunderstorms. It's 5 and there is a practice at 6. The team really needs to shape up before the big game Saturday, and she only wants to cancel if the league makes her, but the league hasn't sent any notifications so she wants to let her team know as soon as she knows.
