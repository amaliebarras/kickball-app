#Paper Prototype

So my first attempt at paper prototype testing was unsuccessful. Here are some of my failure points:

* Recruitment: user was not an iPhone user and was therefore unfamiliar with how you normally behave w/ notifications.
* Handwriting: user was squinting to read my handwriting, which would not happen in a real app scenario, and the help I gave him to read definitely dirtied my results.
* Methodology: Instead of sketching elements, I tried to sketch out every possible state the screen could be in after interactions, which was super confusing

So I learned a lot, but didn't feel like I understood the failures of my flow, so I tried again

With this cleaner prototype, I got some great feedback on the flows themselves. 

* Hierarchy: It matters a lot in mobile since everything is so small, but you have to get creative with how you show it since only a certain range of type sizes will work on a mobile device
* Consistency: The user should be able to see the notification that they are commenting on, the whole time across the journey. 
* Tie it in: This flow doesn't exist in a vacuum - what can the user do after? (This is in the prototype, but the "go to chat" button was drawn in later
