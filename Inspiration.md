#App Inspiration

The three main pieces of the UI for this app will be the newsfeed, leaderboards and stats, and chat. I couldn't find a single app does all of these things well, so I'll divide the inspiration up by section.

##Newsfeed

###[Twitter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8)

I appreciate the way that twitter uses active states to expand and collapse features to preserve real estate. For example, when you land on the twitter page, the "what's happening" field is collapsed, but prominent. When you click on it, however, it expands to include other options. 

Also, 140 characters is just the right amount of space to indicate what sort of content will be in a post. 


##Chat

###[Slack](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12)

Slack is doing it right in terms of chat. It's so straightforward. Slack is a little more complex than the Kickball chat needs to be (ex - I don't think we'll need file sharing?) but the way the conversations are organized & how easy they are to start - are both things to aspire to w/ my design. 

##Leaderboards & Stats

### App Store Top Charts

Getting super meta here. I was looking for an app that had a really obvious sort selector. In my experience building dashboards for users within other softwares, I notice that people don't use the sort filters proportionally to how useful they are, and I hypothesize that it's because they're buried under an ambiguous funnel icon. 

A couple apps with sort filters that I use were Modcloth and Amazon - but I was actually disappointed with how un-obvious they were. So for this research, I actually went to the app store itself to look for a better example, and noticed that they had the top charts page - with three ways to sort - paid, free, and top grossing - all in a horizontal nav. 

I loved it because it's low profile but still pretty obvious.

This only works when you have a few metrics to sort by, and in this case, we do. I suppose you could always have navigation arrows if you had to extend the metric list.
